Debug elements:
- Clicking on the number next to "steps today" on the home page will increment steps. This was for testing without a phone.
- Right now progress updates are happening every minute. And power updates happen every 24 minutes. For an actual app this will be changed to 1 hour for progress and 24 hours aka 1 day for power. This makes it so you don't need to wait hours to see the app's functionality.

Completion:
+ Step counting while app is open or running in the background (not closed).
+ Power and Progress bars that update periodically even if app is closed.
+ Layouts for Home, Power, Progress, Story, and Stats pages.
+ Animations and buttons that lead to all other pages on Home page
+ Adjustable daily step goal on Power page.
+ Scrollable comics for Story Page.
+ Bar graph with daily statistics and ability to share on Stats page.
- Did not implement database as SharedPreferences were able to do all we desired.
